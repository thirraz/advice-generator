### What I learned

I learned how to fetch an API!!!

```js
const fetchData = async () => {
	const random = Math.floor(Math.random() * 130);
	const res = await fetch(`https://api.adviceslip.com/advice/${random}`)
		.then((r) => r.json())
		.then((data) => setAdvice(data.slip))
		.catch((e) => console.warn(e));
};
```
